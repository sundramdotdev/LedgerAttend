# 🚀 LedgerAttend
### Modernizing Campus Operations through Geofencing & Automation

**LedgerAttend** is a multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to eliminate the administrative friction of running college organizations. It replaces manual, unreliable paperwork with a secure, digital-first ecosystem.

## 🛑 The Problem Statement
College clubs and student chapters currently face three major pain points:
1. **Proxy Attendance:** Standard sign-in sheets allow students to mark attendance for absent friends, compromising event integrity.
2. **Administrative Fatigue:** Manually tracking finances and verifying participation for hundreds of students is time-consuming and prone to error.
3. **Delayed Recognition:** Delivering participation certificates often takes weeks due to manual data entry and distribution.

**LedgerAttend** solves this by using location-based validation and automated cloud workflows to ensure every record is accurate and every certificate is instant.
